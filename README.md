Supervised-Learning-Regression
This model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
To help the Chinese automobile company achieve its business goal of understanding the factors affecting car pricing in the American market, you would need to perform a comprehensive analysis and build a pricing model. Here's a step-by-step plan on how to approach this task:

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Acquire a dataset containing information about various cars sold in the American market.
        Inspect the data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
        Preprocess the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Conduct an initial exploration of the data to understand its distribution, summary statistics, and correlations.
        Visualize data using charts and graphs to identify patterns and relationships between variables.

    Feature Selection:
        Identify which independent variables (features) are relevant to car pricing in the American market.
        Use correlation analysis, feature importance scores, or domain knowledge to select significant features.

    Data Splitting:
        Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set to evaluate model performance.

    Model Selection:
        Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression analysis. Common choices include:
            Linear Regression
            Decision Trees
            Random Forest
            Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
            Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

    Model Training:
        Train the selected model on the training data using the chosen features.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using relevant metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess how             well the model describes car pricing.

    Feature Importance Analysis:
        Interpret the model to understand which variables are significant in predicting car prices. Some models provide feature importance scores that can help in this analysis
